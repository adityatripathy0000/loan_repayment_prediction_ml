Loan-Repayment-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-and-Python


Aim:-

Our aim from the project is to make use of numpy, pandas, & seaborn libraries from python to extract insights from the data & scikit-learn libraries for machine learning.

And in the end, to predict whether the loan applicant can repay the loan or not using logistic regression machine learning algorithm.


Attributes in the dataset:-

Loan id,
Gender,
Married,
Dependents,
Education,
Self Employed,
